# Azure Architecture for Intelligent Document Insights Portal

This document outlines the Azure cloud architecture that powers our Intelligent Document Insights Portal.

## Architecture Overview

![Azure Architecture Diagram](./docs/images/azure_architecture.png)

Our solution leverages a comprehensive suite of Azure services to create a scalable, resilient, and high-performance application:

## Core Azure Services

### Compute & Hosting
- **Azure App Service**: Hosts our front-end React application with auto-scaling enabled
- **Azure Functions**: Powers serverless document processing workflows
- **Azure Container Apps**: Hosts microservices for specialized document processing tasks
- **Azure Kubernetes Service**: Manages our AI model deployment containers

### Storage & Database
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Stores uploaded documents and processed results
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Stores document metadata, user preferences, and analytics
- **Azure Cache for Redis**: Caches frequently accessed document insights
- **Azure Data Lake Storage**: Archives historical document data for analytics

### Messaging & Integration
- **Azure Service Bus**: Handles asynchronous processing of documents
- **Azure Event Grid**: Triggers document processing workflows
- **Azure API Management**: Manages API access and throttling
- **Azure Logic Apps**: Orchestrates complex document workflows

### Security & Identity
- **Azure Key Vault**: Securely stores API keys and secrets
- **Azure Active Directory**: Manages user authentication and authorization
- **Azure Private Link**: Secures connections to Azure services
- **Azure DDoS Protection**: Protects against distributed denial-of-service attacks

### AI & Analytics
- **Azure AI Services**: Powers document analysis and insights
- **Azure Cognitive Search**: Enables full-text search across documents
- **Azure Monitor**: Provides application insights and monitoring
- **Azure Log Analytics**: Centralizes log collection and analysis

## Scalability Design

Our architecture is designed to scale automatically based on demand:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - App Service Plan configured with auto-scaling rules based on CPU utilization and request queue length
   - Azure Functions consumption plan scales to zero when idle and up to hundreds of instances during peak load
   - Azure Kubernetes Service configured with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

2. **Vertical Scaling**:
   - Cosmos DB provisioned throughput scales up/down based on demand
   - Cache tier adjusts automatically based on usage patterns

3. **Load Management**:
   - Azure Front Door provides global load balancing
   - Traffic Manager routes requests to the nearest data center
   - Rate limiting implemented via API Management

## High Availability & Disaster Recovery

- **Multi-region Deployment**: 
  - Primary: East US
  - Secondary: West US
  - Failover configured via Traffic Manager

- **Backup Strategy**:
  - Database: Point-in-time backups with 30-day retention
  - Blob Storage: Geo-redundant storage with 99.99999999999% (12 9's) durability
  - Application state: Stateless design with externalized configuration

- **SLAs**:
  - Application uptime: 99.95%
  - Data durability: 99.999999999%
  - Recovery Point Objective (RPO): < 5 minutes
  - Recovery Time Objective (RTO): < 30 minutes

## Azure DevOps Integration

Our CI/CD pipeline leverages Azure DevOps to:
- Automatically build and test code changes
- Deploy to staging environments for validation
- Promote to production with blue/green deployment strategy
- Monitor application health post-deployment

## Cost Optimization

We optimize costs through:
- Service right-sizing based on actual usage
- Automated scaling to zero for development environments
- Reserved instances for predictable workloads
- Consumption-based pricing for variable workloads

## Performance Optimization

- Azure CDN delivers static assets from edge locations
- Azure Front Door routes users to the nearest data center
- Redis Cache reduces database load for frequent queries
- Premium-tier storage for performance-critical workloads

## Monitoring & Operations

- Application Insights tracks performance metrics and user behavior
- Log Analytics centralizes logs across all services
- Custom dashboards provide real-time visibility into system health
- Alerts configured for anomaly detection and threshold breaches

## Compliance & Security

- Azure Security Center monitors security posture
- Azure Policy enforces organizational standards
- Azure Sentinel provides security information and event management
- Regular security scans and penetration testing
